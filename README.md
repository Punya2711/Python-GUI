# 🐍 Python GUI Experiments (aka: Things I Built to practice)

> *Small apps. Big personality.* 

This repository contains **Python GUI applications** I built for myself — not for grades, not for production, not for world domination (yet). Just curiosity, boredom, and the sudden urge to *automate my own life*.

They’re complete, functional, and slightly unhinged.

## 📦 Projects Inside

### 🎓 GPA Calculator

A simple GUI-based GPA calculator built because:

* I wanted to **track my grades** 
* Got confused with page calculation so.. why not
* And typing formulas repeatedly felt like emotional damage

#### ✨ Features

* Input subject grades
* Calculates GPA instantly
* Clean and minimal interface
* No judgment. Just numbers.

#### 🛠 Libraries Used

* `tkinter` – GUI framework
* `math` – for calculations (because math exists whether we like it or not)

Status: ✅ **Completed & stable**

### 🎵 Music Player App

Built out of **pure boredom** and curiosity.

It plays music. It pauses music. Sometimes it freezes like it saw a ghost and gets stuck in a loop.

#### ✨ Features

* Play / pause audio files
* Basic controls
* Minimal UI
* Random occasional lag

#### 🛠 Libraries Used

* `tkinter` – GUI
* `pygame` – audio playback
* `os` – file handling

Status: ⚠️ **Works, but haunted** 👻

## 🧪 Notes from the Developer (me)

* These apps are **not overengineered**
* Code is readable, beginner-friendly, and honest
* Bugs were fixed until they stopped being funny
* Remaining bugs have been accepted as personality traits

## 🏁 Final Thoughts

This repo is small, personal, and imperfect.

It represents learning by doing — and sometimes breaking — which is kind of the whole point.

If future-me is reading this: hey, you survived.
If anyone else is reading this: sorry you saw this.

✨ *Built with Python.*
